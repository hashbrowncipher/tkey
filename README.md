# Tillitis TKey Sign package

A Go package for communicating with the `signer` device app on a
[Tillitis](https://tillitis.se/) TKey to get cryptographic signatures
over a message.

See the [Go doc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tillitis/tkeysign)
for `tkeysign` for details on how to call the functions.

See [apps repo](https://github.com/tillitis/tillitis-key1-apps/) for
example client and device applications, including `signer`.
